# Challenging Careers

- Equal opportunity to girls and boys to serve the Motherland.

- No gender bias.

- Youngsters (both girls and boys of less than 25 years) who aspire to choose a career of excitement, adventure and challenges can find no better place than defence and paramilitary forces to meet all their professional expectations.

"Challenging Careers" is a gate-way not only to select a career full of challenges and adventures but also provides an opportunity to the girls to kill the cliche that certain jobs are gender specific or stereotype.
